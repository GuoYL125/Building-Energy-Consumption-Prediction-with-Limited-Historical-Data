# Building Energy Consumption Prediction with Limited Historical Data
 
The deep learning model mainly refers to "Modeling Long- and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural Networks". 

On this basis, some modifications are made to the problem of building energy consumption, as well as data pre-processing and data post-processing.

# Data Sources

The dataset mainly comes from the energy consumption data of Chongqing Halo Building provided by Hongkong Land. After simple data desensitization processing, the dataset is public at here.
